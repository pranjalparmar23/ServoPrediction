# Servo Prediction

This project is focused on predicting the performance of a servo system based on various input parameters. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and predict outcomes effectively.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance visualization

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/pranjalparmar23/ServoPrediction.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
cd ServoPrediction

3. **Install Dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
jupyter notebook

## Usage
1. Open the `ServoPrediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps in the notebook for data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
3. Modify code sections as needed for experimentation or customization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be accessed from notebook itself. It includes parameters such as:
- Motor torque
- Servo speed
- Environmental conditions
- Other relevant servo system factors

## Model Details
The project utilizes:
- **Regression Models** for performance prediction
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²)

## Results
Performance metrics are visualized using plots to help interpret model accuracy and effectiveness.
